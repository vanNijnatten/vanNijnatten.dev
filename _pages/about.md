I am a data scientist, and former bioinformatician and software developer, now working at **Valcon**, a data consultancy firm, based in the Netherlands. During my everyday work, I use **PySpark** and **DataBricks** to gain knowledge and insights from data.

I gained my Ph.D. in medical science at [UTS](https://www.uts.edu.au), [RUG](https://www.rug.nl) and [UMCG](http://www.umcg.nl) with my thesis titled "Defining COPD and Severe (Early Onset) COPD using a Multi-Omics Approach". My research was focussed on applying modelling techniques to better understand the impact of **(epi)genetics** of **COPD** patients on their disease severity. Additionally, I looked at how **corticosteroid** treatment impact the epigenetics of COPD patients and their response.

Part of my role at university was being a **teaching assistant** for the **human genetics and precision medicine** and **Human Pathophysiology** courses, starting in the second half of 2023. In the first course, I helped students during bioinformatics workshops, wheras in the second course I helped students to recognize diseases. Outside of university, I help advance people in their **data**, **statistics**, **programming** and **writing** skills. I love photography and videography, running, motorcycles and traveling.
