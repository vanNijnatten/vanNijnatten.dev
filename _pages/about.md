I am a data-intensive medical science Ph.D. candidate at [UTS](https://www.uts.edu.au), [RUG](https://www.rug.nl) and [UMCG](http://www.umcg.nl) specializing in the genetics and epigenetics of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with a keen interest in using **bioinformatics** and **machine learning**. My research is focussed on applying modelling techniques to better understand the impact of **(epi)genetics** of **COPD** patients on their disease severity. Additionally, I look at how **corticosteroid** treatment impacts the epigenetics of COPD patients and their response.

Part of my role at university is being a **teaching assistant** for the **research software engineering with R** course and coursework marker for **something** courses. Outside of university, I help advance people in their **programming** skills. I love photography and videography, running, motorcycles and traveling.
